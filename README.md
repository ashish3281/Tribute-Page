A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this article, I was creating a tribute webpage of Late Lata Mangeskar Ji using HTML and CSS. I was add an image of her at the center (below the title) and create a box beneath that image. Inside that box, I was write a few of his achievements and details. We will use div tag and p tag to write the details and img tag for image. Then using CSS, we will align and beautify the design. 

<b>Approach:</b>
<hr>
In the <body> element, I was give the title of the page using h1 tag after that i was add an image of her in the img tag with some caption. I was create another div tag and write all the contents (using p tags). I was also given ID for each tag so that we can beautify the design using respective-ID in the CSS file.
In the CSS section i was basically maintained a central design and used shadow to create effect around the main content.
